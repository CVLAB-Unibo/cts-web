                            LiDAR semantic segmentation is receiving increased attention due to its deployment in autonomous driving applications. As LiDARs come often with other sensors such as RGB cameras, multi-modal approaches for this task have been developed, which however suffer from the domain shift problem as other deep learning approaches. To address this, we propose a novel Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) technique for multi-modal LiDAR segmentation. Unlike previous works in this field, we leverage depth completion as an auxiliary task to align features extracted from 2D images across domains, and as a powerful data augmentation for LiDARs.
                            We validate our method on three popular multi-modal UDA benchmarks and we achieve better performances than other competitors.
